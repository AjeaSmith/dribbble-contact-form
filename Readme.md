### Design decisions:
 - "Montserrat" font. It can be found here [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
 - Flexbox for layout design

### Helpful Links

### About the project
I can definitely say this project gave me a bit of a workout (lol). But learning how to do each piece step by step and actually getting this project completed made me feel like a SUPERHERO!. I'll make this easier by making a list of challenges I came across. But, with the help of the above links and some testing I was able to get it done, and I'm very proud with the final results. :) 

- Making shapes with backgrounds using css. In my case, creating a shape with a background image. 
- Adding a gradient background on top of that image.
- Creating a location like track (pink location) (along with the shape)
- Figuring out how to make it look good for mobile as well. 
- I'd admit, the html is not structured in the best way. I had to nest a lot of things (in my opinion) to play nice with flexbox.

I believe this project really gave me my wings. I learned so much and accomplished more than I expected.
